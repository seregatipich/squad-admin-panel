# Changelog

## 2026-04-26 (property tests)

### Added
- Extracted `nameToSlug`, `sanitizeSlug`, and `CYRILLIC_TO_LATIN` from `page.tsx` into `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/servers/new/_slug.ts` so they are importable by tests.
- Property-based tests for slug logic in `apps/web/test/property/slug.test.ts` (4 properties, 100 runs each): output always matches SLUG_RE, no leading dash after sanitize, 64-char max, already-valid slugs round-trip.

## 2026-04-26

### Removed
- `/servers` page: status filter chips (`all/running/starting/stopped/ready/failed/installing/pending`). Free-text search remains. The status dot per row already conveys state at a glance, and the chips added noise without payoff. Underlying `STATUS_FILTERS` constant and `filter` state deleted.

## 2026-04-25

### Added
- `/roles` page: filterable role list with `RoleColorDot`, edit/delete actions gated by `role:edit` / `role:delete`.
- `/roles/new` page: `RoleEditor` in create mode, POST /api/v1/roles on submit.
- `/roles/[id]` page: `RoleEditor` in edit mode; read-only banner for Owner system role.
- `/users` page: panel user list (players with non-null `role_id`), `AssignModal` for role assignment via player search.
- `RoleEditor` component: full permission checkboxes grouped by category, color picker, search filter, read-only guard for Owner role.
- `RoleColorDot` component: 16-color dot for use in role tables and color pickers.
- `PanelAccessSection` on `/players/[steam_id64]`: inline role assignment with Owner confirm dialog and last-Owner guard (409 handling).
- `/no-access` landing page for authenticated users without a panel role.
- Sidebar conditional links for Roles (`role:view`) and Users (`user:view`).
- Owner role confirm dialog in `AssignModal` and `PanelAccessSection`.

### Removed
- `/setup` page removed from the route table (setup flow superseded by the first-owner auto-claim).
